## Description

The main purpose of this application is to connect people together. In the world when people suddenly found themselves separated from their usual circle of friends, relatives and co-workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is especially important to create small events that will enhance your life, spirit, and help you push through the tough experience. The application is to help people invite their friends, relatives, co-workers or neighbours for small events like bike rides, group workouts, walk through the parks or volunteering activities.It could be used to connect with people from your sport club, church or neighborhood.

EConnect is a full-stack web application that uses the Sequelize ORM, a promise-based Node.js ORM for MySQL. It is an event logging platform that utilizes MySQL, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, Passport and the OMDB API. It utilizes the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in Events App, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

## Functionality

- This app requires users to sign up/create an account and log into the account subsequently. All user data is securely stored in mysql database with the password being hashed.

- After signing-in, user is redirected to the home page that shows all the scheduled events and allows the authenticated user create a new event

- User can view the detailed info for the event by clicking on the event name or using 'More about this event' button. He will be presented with the details as well as all the invitees and comments for the event.

- User can create a new event by using a "Create New Event" button. After that, he will be presented with a form to complete name, date, time, location, and the description for the event. User could invite any number of people who are also registered users for the app.

- Each user is able to leave his comments on the event page that also serves as a message board for the event. For example, host can enter "Bring your own blankets" message for "Lunch in the Park" event and invitees can use the message board to RSVP the invitation or ask host to answer a question about the event.

## Database

The application uses MySQL database called event_db that consists of the following tables/models connected via SEQUELIZE TABLE ASSOCIATIONS.

1. USERS: id, first name, last name, email, password, created_at and updated_at timestamps (auto)
2. EVENTS: id, name of the event, event date, event time, event location, event description, full name of the host, created_at and updated_at timestamps (auto generated by SEQUELIZE)
3. INVITEES: id, invitee's first and last name, email, created_at and updated_at timestamps and EVENT_ID that is a foreign key for the connection to the EVENTS table
4. COMMENTS: id, body (comment), name of the person who left the comment, created_at, updated_at, and EVENT_ID that is a foreign key for the connection to the EVENTS table

Associations: EVENT has many INVITEES, EVENT has many COMMENTS,
INVITEE belongs to EVENT, COMMENT belongs to EVENT

## Installation

To use this application locally:

- Install Node.js on your computer.
- Use `npm init` to build package.json and node_modules.
- Use `npm install` to install all the dependencies, see [Dependencies](#dependencies) for the complete list
- Utilizing MySQL or MSSQL workbench, create the DB using the schema.sql file
- Use the _seed.sql_ file to popluate the DB
- Once you have all the above created, you can edit the _server.js_ file where the password is and add your password to access your local DataBase.
- Open a terminal, navigate to the folder where **_server.js_** is located and type: `node server.js`
- Once the server is running, open a browser and navigate to localhost:8080 or the port you have selected
